1) Recaptcha - revisit

2) Check resizing headers

3) New Gallery Page set up - if this could be added to the Parish test site I'll have a play around.

These are the items from last month, not sure what has been done and what's still to do:-

 

1) Make sure all sites are up to date with the latest widgets, code, templates, site config (Norfolk and Suffolkbiz)

2) Photo Gallery - Phone display needs looking at

3) Lightbox view - make proportionate (quite small when in full size so if this could be bigger)

4) Event Calendar - sort styles

6) Make colour schemes (themes) modula???? (Easy to roll out)

7) Fonts - add Lato, Droid and could we have a bigger font one for people with not much text on pages?

8) Recaptcha - needs sorting.
